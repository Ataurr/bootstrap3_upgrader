# Bootstrap 3 HTML Upgrader

This project is meant to serve two dual purposes:

1. To provide an automated way to upgrade stock Bootstrap HTML from version 2.3 to 3.0
2. To provide a comprehensive checklist of actions that need to be performed in such an upgrade

While it may not be possible to use our DOM-based upgrader on template-based HTML,
we are striving to document each rule extensively such that you can go through the
checklist yourself and upgrade manually if necessary.
